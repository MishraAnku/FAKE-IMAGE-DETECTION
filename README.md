3. Challenges
   - Identifying subtle manipulations or alterations in images that may not be visually obvious.
   - Handling a wide range of image manipulation techniques, including content insertion, cloning, and color modification.
   - Dealing with adversarial attacks aimed at evading detection algorithms.
   - Balancing detection accuracy with computational complexity and resource requirements.

4. Challenges Overcome
   - Leveraging advanced image processing techniques and algorithms for detecting various types of image manipulations.
   - Incorporating robust deep learning models capable of learning complex patterns and features indicative of fake images.
   - Implementing ensemble methods or multi-stage detection pipelines to improve detection accuracy and robustness.
   - Regularly updating and fine-tuning detection algorithms to adapt to evolving manipulation techniques.

5. Aim
   The aim of this project is to develop an effective and reliable fake image detection system capable of automatically identifying manipulated or synthesized images to mitigate the spread of misinformation and fraudulent content online.

6. Purpose
   The purpose of this project is to address the growing threat of fake images proliferating on the internet by providing users, platforms, and organizations with a tool to detect and mitigate the impact of deceptive and misleading visual content.
